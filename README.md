This project involves creating a interactive streamlite app with following inputs and outputs,

Inputs: Using Slider Bar: Initial Amount, Gain %, Loss %, Probability of Gain
Outputs: Graphs

Process:
Based on the input, generate random values for 60 steps for 1000 People and store their wealth after each steps in a dataframe.
Create three graphs such as Ensemble average (Line Chart using Altair), End wealth distribution (Bar Chart with mean marked as line using Altair), wealth distribution progression (mixed line chart using Altair)
